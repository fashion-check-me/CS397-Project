# fashion-check.me

## Description

Yet another social website, this time built around fashion: users upload outfits, label them, other users vote up/down the outfits they like/dislike. Some sort of data mining / machine learning will be able to predict (and recommend) outfits a user might like, based on overall likes and the user's previous likes (similar to how Netflix can recommend movies for you).

## Authors

The unfashionables are:

* Josh Hertlein
* Ann Doerfler
* Kelsey Maricic
* Chris Jackson
* Andrew Rhoads
* Dane Greet

Josh is the project lead.

# Motivation

Our group project for CS397, and a very roundabout way to crowdsource the problem that we are terrible at fashion.
